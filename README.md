# Data Analytics Project #1 

Welcome to my first project on Github! This is the  **Music Store Data Analysis Project** repository! 

This project is a small demonstration of my understandings of SQL Query writing, from basic to intermediate query prompting including ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY, etc. 

--- 

The Queries can be found as "Music Store Data Analysis" and the database file used to create the database in Postgressql is "Music_store_database".
